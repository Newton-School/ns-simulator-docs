# HLD Simulator Docs

A comprehensive guide to building discrete event simulation engines for modeling and validating high-level system designs.

## Overview

This repository provides everything needed to understand and build a **Discrete Event Simulation (DES) engine** for distributed system architecture. It walks through the theory, data structures, and implementation details required to simulate system behavior — letting you discover bottlenecks, test scaling strategies, and validate designs before writing production code.

## Documentation

### [System Overview](docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)

The single source of truth for understanding the simulator end-to-end. Covers how the simulation engine works, the three user phases (BUILD → SIMULATE → ANALYSE), UI representation (screen layout, canvas states, inspector, JSON topology viewer, results tray), CLI commands, component inventory, feature-to-ticket map, and design foundations.

### [Theoretical Foundations](docs/theoretical-foundations.md)

Maps academic theory to simulator features — queueing theory (G/G/c/K, Little's Law), DEVS formalism, probability distributions, reliability theory, graph theory, and control theory.

### [Part 1 — System Diagrams](docs/01-system-diagrams.md)

Covers the building blocks of any system diagram:

- **Nodes** — source, processing, storage, routing, sink, and composite nodes with their properties (capacity, processing speed, availability)
- **Edges** — synchronous, asynchronous, streaming, conditional, and weighted connections with failure modes
- **Patterns** — sequence, fork, join, branch, loop, and parallel composition
- Real-world examples across domains (hospitals, factories, e-commerce, web systems)

### [Part 2 — Simulation Fundamentals](docs/02-simulation-fundamentals.md)

Introduces core simulation concepts:

- The three ingredients: **model** (structure), **engine** (time progression), **observer** (measurements)
- Events, state, and the event loop
- Key parameters: arrival rate (lambda), capacity (K, c), service rate (mu), utilization (rho)
- Queues, overflow strategies, and Little's Law
- Randomness, distributions (exponential, log-normal, Poisson), and deterministic replay via seeded PRNGs

### [Part 3 — Data Structures & Mechanics](docs/03-data-structures-and-mechanics.md)

Covers implementation in depth with working code:

- **Min-heap** — O(log n) event queue with full JavaScript implementation
- **Precision & determinism** — BigInt timestamps, SFC32 PRNG, distribution generators
- **G/G/c/K queueing model** — formalizing node behavior with Kendall's notation
- **Workload generation** — constant, Poisson, bursty, diurnal, and spike traffic patterns
- **Simulation engine** — complete implementation with event handlers, latency percentiles (P50/P90/P95/P99), and Little's Law verification

### [Part 4 — Distributed Systems & Failures](docs/04-distributed-systems-and-failures.md)

Models real-world distributed system complexity:

- **Distributed systems** — dependency graphs, critical vs optional dependencies, fallback behavior
- **Network physics** — latency decomposition (propagation + transmission + processing + queuing + jitter), congestion modeling
- **Failure modes** — crash, omission, timing, response, Byzantine; resource exhaustion taxonomy
- **Failure propagation** — timeout cascades, retry amplification, resource starvation, thundering herd, cache stampede
- **Resilience patterns** — circuit breaker, bulkhead, retry with backoff, backpressure, rate limiting, load shedding

### [Part 5 — DEVS, Chaos Engineering & Output Analysis](docs/05-devs-chaos-and-analysis.md)

Formalizes the simulator and adds validation:

- **DEVS formalism** — atomic and coupled DEVS models, time advance functions, hierarchical composition
- **Chaos engineering** — structured experiment workflow, fault injection catalog, pre-built experiments
- **Output analysis** — metrics collection, waterfall traces, heatmaps, causal failure graphs, bottleneck identification

## Canonical Catalogue

The [`canonical-catalogue/`](canonical-catalogue/) directory contains 17 CSV reference files covering:

- **Component taxonomy** — ~110+ component types across 13 categories (compute, network, storage, messaging, orchestration, security, observability, DevOps, data infra, real-time, integration, consensus, DNS)
- **Component specification** — YAML schema template and uniform attributes every component must support
- **Simulation primitives** — event types, workload profiles (spike, steady-state, diurnal, bursty), and fault injection modes
- **Failure modes** — cascading failures, backpressure, split-brain, thundering herd, resource exhaustion, and propagation rules
- **Patterns & anti-patterns** — 23 architectural patterns (CQRS, Saga, Circuit Breaker, etc.) and 8 anti-patterns to detect
- **Metrics & SLIs** — latency percentiles, throughput, availability, saturation, cost, and recovery time
- **Policies & invariants** — idempotency, causal ordering, consistency, and security checks
- **Pre-built scenarios** — 7 deterministic test scenarios (cache stampede, DB failover, network partition, auth outage, traffic spike, and more)
- **Provider mapping** — AWS / GCP / Azure equivalents for multi-cloud simulation
- **Implementation guidance** — architecture recommendations, utility components, and a completeness checklist

See [`canonical-catalogue/README.md`](canonical-catalogue/README.md) for detailed descriptions of each file.

## Schema

[`schema/complete_simulator_schema.ts`](schema/complete_simulator_schema.ts) consolidates the full type system for the simulator (2300+ lines), incorporating definitions from both the documentation and the canonical catalogue. It is organized into 17 parts:

- **Component types** — union types for all ~110+ component types plus a unified `ComponentType`
- **Component specification** — `ComponentDefinition` with identity, resources, lifecycle, dependencies, health checks, telemetry, SLOs, fault injection, scaling, and security
- **Simulation events** — `SimulationEvent` with 50+ event types and typed `EventData` variants
- **Failure propagation** — `FailurePropagation` with conditions and cascading effects
- **Workload profiles** — 8 traffic pattern types (steady-state, spike, diurnal, sawtooth, bursty, long-tail, replay, custom)
- **Fault injection** — `FaultInjection` with 14 fault types and deterministic/probabilistic/conditional timing
- **Metrics & outputs** — `MetricsDefinition`, `SimulationOutput` with traces, heatmaps, causal graphs, and reproducibility specs
- **Scaling & invariants** — horizontal/vertical scaling simulation, shard rebalancing, and invariant checks
- **Provider configs** — cloud-specific latency, quotas, and cost profiles (includes pre-built `AWS_PROFILE`)
- **Utilities** — `ScenarioComposer`, `CostCalculator`, `ImpactCalculator`, `ReplayEngine`, `DesignComparator`
- **Built-in scenarios** — 5 pre-configured `BUILT_IN_SCENARIOS` (cache stampede, DB crash, network partition, auth outage, traffic spike)
- **Distribution configs** — 12 statistical distributions (normal, log-normal, exponential, Poisson, Weibull, gamma, beta, Pareto, empirical, mixture, etc.)
- **Component configs** — type-specific configurations for APIs, databases, caches, queues, streams, serverless functions, CDNs, SFUs, and gateways

See [`schema/README.md`](schema/README.md) for the full breakdown.

## Planning

The [`planning/`](planning/) directory contains the implementation roadmap:

- [**Implementation Plan**](planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) — 10-phase build plan covering topology JSON format, core primitives, simulation engine, network modeling, failure injection, resilience patterns, metrics/output, chaos scenarios, UI integration, and advanced features. Includes dependency graph, file structure, and the critical path for an MVP.

- [**Tickets**](planning/TICKETS.md) — 46 self-contained engineering tickets with detailed specs, acceptance criteria, dependency chains, and size estimates. Organized into 12 phases covering the core engine, UI components, topology state management, CLI, and more.

## Design Decisions

The [`design-decisions/`](design-decisions/) directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs):

- [**Internal Modularity Over Plugin System**](design-decisions/adr-internal-modularity-over-plugin-system.md) — Why the engine uses internal module boundaries instead of a runtime plugin system. The core DES loop is domain-agnostic; domain logic (queueing, network, failures) is structured as modules with clean interfaces, but ships as one package.

- [**No Custom Change Detection**](design-decisions/adr-no-custom-change-detection.md) — Why no mutation observer or custom reactivity is needed. BUILD-phase state uses Zustand selector subscriptions. SIMULATE-phase data uses Web Worker `postMessage`. Both feed into React's standard re-render cycle.
